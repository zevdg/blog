You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :----- | :---------- | :-------------- |
| Five   | Six         | Four            |
| Ten    | Eleven      | Nine            |
| Seven  | Eight       | Six             |
| Two    | Three       | One             |

How about a yummy crepe?

Here's a code chunk with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return x + 5;
};
foo(3);
```
