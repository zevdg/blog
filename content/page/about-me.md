I'm a full-stack polyglot developer currently residing in Morgantown, WV.  
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing music or devil's advocate.

I'm particularly well versed in Go, PWAs, and Firebase.  
[Contact me](mailto:Zev.Goldstein@gmail.com) if you are looking for a speaker on one of these topics.

### Bloomberg LP - Systems Infrastructure Champ

I started at Bloomberg as a full stack developer. Over time, I found myself wearing the hats of scrum master, project leader and champ. For the non-Bloombergers out there, champs are the developer experience conduit between the application developers and the infrastructure teams. In my department, there were 2 champs and about 400 devs. We were the ones developers came to when they wanted guidance or ran into a problem that they couldn't find a good solution for. If those solutions already existed, it was our job to know about them and educate. If not, we made sure that the use-case made it back to the right infrastructure team and was prioritized correctly.

My personal motto in this role was
![That's what I do. I drink, and I know things.](/img/drink-and-know-things.jpg)

### Case Western Reserve University

Aaaah college. That place where we paid a lot of money in order to be employable.  
Some of us even managed to learn a few things.
